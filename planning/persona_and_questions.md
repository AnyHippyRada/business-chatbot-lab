## User Persona

**Name:** Jonas — a bread-baking enthusiast, two months into his sourdough journey  
**Context:** Jonas has already mastered the starter-pack of beginner bread recipes and picked up the basics of sourdough types and techniques. He'd ideally bake at least once a week but in reality often gets overwhelmed trying to choose a recipe that fits his mood, ingredients, and available time.  
**Pain Point:** Almost every week, Jonas struggles to decide what kind of bread to bake — sometimes giving up and baking nothing at all (a tragedy in carbs and spirit).
