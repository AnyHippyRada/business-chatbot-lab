## Chatbot Lab â€“ Project Vision

My chatbot helps my nearest and dearest come up with an idea for a bread he wants to bake according to his mood, available ingredients and the time it takes so he can experiment around with bread recipes and provide us both with filled with love carbohydrates. 


In two weeks I will deliver a lightweight bread-FAQ prototype deployed locally, laying the groundwork for analytics, future LLM integration, and public cloud hosting.
